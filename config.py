## synaptic connectivity parameters (see Krishnan's network.cfg)
## note that all strengths are the TOTAL synaptic strength impinging on each post-synaptic cell; the actual weight of any one synapse will be the total syn strength DIVIDED BY the number of presynaptic connections received by the particular neuron species in question
## note that all strenghts are by default prescribed in NEURON in units of microSiemens, while Krishnan's currents.cpp uses milliSiemens
## also, Krishnan's currents.cpp prescribes a delay of 0 for all synapses, but NEURON does not like that, so they have all been set to 0.1 ms
## there are many factors of "0.75" because I found that my NEURON model gives similar to results to Bazhenov 2002 C++ code when the synaptic strength
## is 0.75 that of the C++ code for pyramidal and inhibitory post-synatpic neurons (presumably because I used a full model for these cells, while
## Bazhenov et al used a reduced model)
